1.  remove element from left and right end of array. you have to remove k element such that ramaning array sum is maximum.

Solution: prefix sum with sliding window.
T(n) = O(n)


2. we have stream of interger. in every ith integer give minimum absulute differance of piar from any integer of 1 to ith integer.

Solution: Order set
          -> store cuurentMinDiff. 
          -> get ith itger order let say o1. (logn)
          -> get o1-1th and o1+1th element ans get min diff. (logn)
          -> update currentMinDiff. (1)
T(n) = O(n(longn + logn))
